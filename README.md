Hello All ! Welcome to my To-DO list API

In order to start you can go to my github repository where you can basically clone the entire code onto your machine.

After going to this link, you will the name of the Repository "Project2-API-Todo" and a green Code next to it. 
Clik on that green code and click on SSH, and copy the link that pops up.
Next Open your terminal, and change the current directory to where you want the clone.
